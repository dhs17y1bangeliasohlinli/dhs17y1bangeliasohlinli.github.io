<h1> Little India </h1>
<p> On the second day, we went to Little India. Little India is a place full of culture. </p>

<p> It was a very fruitful journey. We visited the Indian Heritage Centre. We had to gather information from the museum for a group project for History.
After that, we had to interview a garland maker. We asked him questions and he very willingly helped us. In return for his kindness, I bought a garland from him.
We got to taste candies from Little India. The candies tasted very interesting and some of them were surprisingly nice. Then, we went to get Henna. It was a 
cool experience to have a professional to do Henna for me. Also, it was only $3 and the process was rather fast. The Henna looked very pretty and I was very satisfied.
The Henna only lasted a few days but I bought a tube of Henna to do it myself. </p>
<p> Overall, Little India is very fun and I would like to re-visit the place if I have the chance. </p>

<h1> MacRitchie Reservoir </h1>
<p> On the third day, we went to <a href="macritchie.png"> MacRitchie Reservoir</a>. It is Singapore's oldest reservoir. It is not my first time there, so I have a sense of familarity.
In primary 6, I went to MacRitchie Reservoir for a endurement hike. Even though we did no9t hike this time, I was still excited to go to MacRitchie again as the scenary is beautiful there. 
This time, we went to MacRitchie for a group project for Geography. We did water  testing and the water there was surprisingly clean. It is also very ideal for animals and plants living 
underwater. However, it started raining, so we had to rush through the water testing. The water testing was rather fun and interesting </p>
<p> Overall, the learning journey to MacRitchie Reservoir was educational and meaningful. Through this learning journey, I also learnt that I should use water sparingly and not waste water. </p>
